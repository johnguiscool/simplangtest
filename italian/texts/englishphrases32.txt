Camille, you seem pensive.
What are you thinking about?
John wants to read some books in French,
so I want to give him my books.
Which books will you give him?
I still don't know.
I will go home to look for some good books.
Will you have vacations next week?
Yes.
Yes, I will go to the sea.
With who?
With John, of course.
Where will you go, exactly?
To Liguria
