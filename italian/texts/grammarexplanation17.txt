<b>Ti invito da me.</b> is a slightly idiomatic expression.  <b>Ti invito...</b> means [I invite you...], but <b>da me</b> translates literally to [of me] means [to my place], in this context.

<p>Just like in English, the word for [which], <b>questo</b>, functions as an adjective and as an indicative noun.</p>
