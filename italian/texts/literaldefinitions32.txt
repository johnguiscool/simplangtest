Alessia  you-seem pensive 
to what-thing you-are thinking 
John wants to-read some books Italians 
so I him will-give the my books 
which books him you-will-give 
not it I-know still
I-will-go to home for look-for of-the  good books 
you-will-go in vacation the next week 
yes
I-will-go to-the sea 
with who 
with John  naturally 
where you-will-go  exactly 
in Liguria
