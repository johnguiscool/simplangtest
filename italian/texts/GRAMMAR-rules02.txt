<h4>The Present Continuous Tense vs. The Aorist Tense</h4>

Turkish actually has two present tenses, the present continuous tense, and the aorist tense.  <p>

The present continuous tense (<b>-iyor</b> suffix) is used to express action that is currently in progress.  It is equivalent to the English present progressive tense.

<p>
<b>Eve gidiyorum.</b> - I am going home.
<br>
<b>Ne yapiyorsun?</b> - What are you doing?
<p>

The aorist tense (<b>-r</b> suffix) is used to express habitual, daily actions and routines.  It is equivalent to the English simple present tense.

<p>
<b>Her gun, dili okulusu giderim.</b> - I go to language school every day.
<br>
<b>Her sabah, erken kalerim.</b> - I wake up early every morning.

<p>
These are the official uses of these tenses.  However, in practice, the two tenses are largely interchangeable, and determining which tense to use in a given situation is slightly idiomatic.  In general, the present continuous tense (<b>-iyor</b> suffix) is more commonly used and can typically always be used to express habitual actions.
