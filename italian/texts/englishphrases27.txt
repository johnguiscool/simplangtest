You seem sad, John.
Yes, I am sad.
Why?
I love Alessia, but she has a boyfriend.
Who is her boyfriend?
His name is Marcel.
He is a businessman.
He is rich.
But that is not important.
I think that Alessia wants a sensitive man.
You're right.
I agree.
But Marcello is very pleasant and funny.
And he loves to dance.
Ah!  Then you have a problem.
When Marcello was a student,
 he created an internet company.
Very interesting.
