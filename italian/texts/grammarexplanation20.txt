The Italian phrases used to describe the weather are quite idiomatic and differ from how we would express the same ideas in English.  

<p>
<b>Fa freddo</b> and <b>Fa caldo</b> literally mean [It makes cold] and [It makes hot].  They are equivalent to [it's cold] or [it's hot].

<b>C'è il sole</b> literally means [There is the sun].  This phrase is equivalent to [It's sunny].
