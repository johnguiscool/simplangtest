<b>Bu</b> is the Turkish word for [this], and is used just as in English.

<p>

<b>Arkadaş</b> is the base word for [friend].  Adding the <b>-ım</b> suffix transforms the word to [my friend].

<ul>
<li><b>arkadaş</b><br>friend</li>
<li><b>arkadaşım</b><br>my friend</li>
</ul>

The word <b>biliyorum</b> literally means [I know].  Rather than say [I speak Turkish] to indicate that one has a command of the Turkish, one says [I know Turkish], i.e. <b>Türkçe biliyorum</b>.

<p>

The suffix <b>'da / de</b> means [in] the noun it is attached to:

<ul>
<li><b>İstanbul</b><br>Istanbul</li>
<li><b>İstanbul'da</b><br>in Istanbul</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Merkez</b><br>the center (of a city)</li>
<li><b>Merkezde</b><br>in the center (of a city)</li>
</ul>

In general, prepositional phrases in English like in, at, of, from, etc. are formed using suffixes in Turkish.
