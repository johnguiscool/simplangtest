<h4>Indicatives</h4>

Turkish has the following indicatives:

<p>
<b>bu</b> - this
<br>
<b>şu</b> - that (pointing at an object that can be seen)
<br>
<b>o</b> - that (indicating an object that can not be seen)
<p>

As in English, these indicatives can be used as adjectives or as pronouns.

<p>
<b>bu elma</b> - this apple
<br>
<b>şu ağaç</b> - that tree
<br>
<b>o ev</b> - that house
<hr>

<p>
Recall that there is no word for "is" in the Turkish language.  Therefore, when using indicatives to say "this is an apple", simply say, "bu bir elma".  More examples:

<p>
<b>Bu benim arkadaşım.</b> - This is my friend.
<br>
<b>Bu ne?</b> - What's this?
<br>
<b>Bu bir kalem.</b> - This is a pen.
